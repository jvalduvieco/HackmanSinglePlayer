HackmanSinglePlayer
=========

HackmanJS is an obvious clone of pac-man implemented in JavaScript using MelonJS engine.
This is a fork of [amamaenko's work](https://github.com/amamaenko/HackmanJS) I evolved to near complete functionality and updated to [melonJS](https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS) current (0.9.7).

There is also a Hackman Multiplayer. You can find client [here](https://github.com/jvalduvieco/HackmanJSMultiPlayer) and Erlang/OTP server [here](https://github.com/jvalduvieco/HackmanServer). 

This is WIP.
